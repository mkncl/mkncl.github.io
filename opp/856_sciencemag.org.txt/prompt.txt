72. Social networking services provided on the Science Website (e.g. the Science Careers Community pages) may have additional terms of conduct, privacy policies, and privacy settings that you will be required to agree to and set when you register for such services. 
74. |||USE OF COOKIES 
76. We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages or register for services on any of the Science websites, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password, and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the Science Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. 
78. |||You may have the ability to accept or decline all cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. It is possible to sign in to any of the Science websites without accepting cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience at the Science Website. 
80. |||USE OF WEB BEACONS 
82. Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel GIFs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the Science Website; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. 
84. |||UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION 
86. It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of publications and products. 
88. |||Members can change their personal information or update their account information at any time by linking to http://aaasmember.org and selecting Member Services. Other registrants or users may also update their personal information at any time by sending e-mail to membership{at}aaas.org. 
90. |||SECURITY 
92. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. In addition, all credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. When you place an order online at any of the Science websites, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption utilizing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. 
94. |||The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. When you've finished your transactions and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. A warning window may pop up to notify you that you are entering this "safe" area. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or closed lock will appear in the lower left-hand corner of your screen to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process. In addition, only the last four digits of your credit card number will be revealed on the screen when confirming an order. Of course, we securely transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card service company during order processing.
